Here is a short excerpt from the Texas Solar Rights that refers to this issue. “The law also 
stipulates that the HOA may designate where the solar device should be located on a roof,
unless a homeowner can show that the designation negatively impacts the performance
of the solar energy device and an alternative location would increase production by
more than 10%. To show this, the law requires that modeling tools provided by the
National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) be used.” 

While not specified by name in the law, one of NREL’s available tools that can accomplish this is called PVWatts Calculator.

"Section 2 of the act adds specificity to the requirements that HOAs allow installation
of renewable energy generation devices (e.g solar panels) subject to reasonable
aesthetic guidelines by requiring approval or denial of a completed application
within 60 days and requiring approval if imposition of the aesthetic
guidelines would result in more than a 10% reduction in efficiency or a 10% increase in price
